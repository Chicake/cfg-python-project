# CFG: Python project
## CFG Python course
I have done [this course](https://codefirstgirls.com/courses/classes/uni-kickstarter/) during the summer 2022. It is a 8 weeks course with 2 hours class per week (and homework), which covered the following topics:
- Python basics - Data types and Variables
- Using methods
- Problem solving (e.g., if statement)
- Decision making in your program
- Lists and Dictionaries
- Third party libraries and APIs
- Reading and writing files

## Pair project: KaedeAnimeList
This repository contains all the work I have done for the final project of the course (go to [pythonProject.py](https://github.com/Chicake/cfg-python-project/blob/main/pythonProject.py) to see the coding for the project). I worked with one more person from the same course, making it as a pair (group) project. We splitted the work according to our capability; since I learned some data analysis using external packages like seaborn and pandas outside of the CFG course, I was mainly focusing on the glassdoor analysis, although I did help another person for sales csv analysis. It composes of 2 elements: data analysis on [fake sales data](https://github.com/Chicake/cfg-python-project/blob/main/sales.csv) (the data comes from and belongs to CFG python course) and analysing gender pay gap in glassdoor using [this data](https://github.com/Chicake/cfg-python-project/blob/main/Glassdoor%20Gender%20Pay%20Gap.csv), which the [data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nilimajauhari/glassdoor-analyze-gender-pay-gap?phase=startRegisterTab&returnUrl=%2Fdatasets%2Fnilimajauhari%2Fglassdoor-analyze-gender-pay-gap) (go to the link to see where I got the data) is from kaggle, although the licensing is unclear (says others) so I will credit here like this. [Python presentation](https://github.com/Chicake/cfg-python-project/blob/main/Python%20presentation.pdf) is the slides used during the project presentation. I used the slide template from [slidecarnival](https://www.slidescarnival.com/balthasar-free-presentation-template/392), which the hyperlink will take you to the downloading page.
